o in maker defineProperties and _init called from constructor (not _C
but real consstructor)
o Finish with Operation
o Maker to allow _type passed in
o In ACLs how to deal with numeric user spec values vs strings?
o MOngoDBCollection db vs dbs
o Views and forms
o Inchworm /values?ids=
   - maybe id=1&id=2 just works?
o Example where endpoints are in other components
o Error codes
o Flesh out api for MongoDBCollections to be like current data api
o Do example of custom collection
o Do example of feedback form for customer why you left?
o Do a pass on trying to cause errors and see how they get handled
o review sync changes 
o ObjectIds in swagger coming out wrong -- probably toString of ObjectId
o Show example of Inch with nested :id endpoint
o How do we get a log on every object in the system not just top level?
o Why is collection post returning array from insert (driver or us?)
  can see in swagger ui
o Operation class
o Do we want an Endpoint.operations() that gets all the defined operations?
o What's up with swagger and :id? vs :id
o change apiRootPath to path and make ObjectServer an Endpoint
o How does one make /bin wrappers. shebang or bsh?
o test _super more -- in Inchworm.js it freaked
o ObjectServer an Endpoint
o in swagger ui if you do an obj get with no id the request url is
odd. Think this is swagge bug
   http://Wills-MacBook-Pro.local:8888/zipcodes/{id}

LATER
o try subclassing Collection, review start taking cb but init not
doing so 
o X-Powered-By: Express
o UserOwnedMDBCollection
o Auth / AC per endpoint? Telemetry example is a good one
o envelope format for GET
o validate schema 
o client 
o client cmdline 
o shell
o socket.io
o CREATE method
o MongoDBDatabase endpoint
  - I think we should be able to re-use MongoDBCollections even if we
  are lazy to create them, but might choose to impl not lazy collction creation?
o decide on /lib/ shorcut in maker
o write reasoning for o({...}) to understand _type in nested docs vs
needed nested o({...})
- LRU cache endpoint based on a field
o what is difference between PUT and PATCH?

PUNTED?
o start/stpo at cmdline? NO THIS SHOULD BE MANAGED BY PROCESS MANAGER
o
