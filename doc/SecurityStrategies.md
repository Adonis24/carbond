Security strategies
----------

When creating APIs there are two general strategies one can take towards security. One strategy is to implement security implicity, by virtue of the way the code is written. The other is to use more explicit definitions of access control to define user permissions on endpoints and data. 

The two strategies can, and often are, combined within the same API having Endpoints that use a variety of techniques. 

Both techniques rely on Object Server [authentication](Authentication.md).

Implicit security is a strategy that most resembles the way security is 

### Explicit Security
